// Day 2: Operators

//Tasks/Activities:

//Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

//Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 20;

console.log(num1 + num2);

//Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 - num2);

//Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 * num2);

//Task 4: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 / num2);

//Task 1: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
console.log(num1 % num2);

//Activity 2: Assignment Operators

//Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console
let variable = 5;
variable += 10;
console.log(variable);

//Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number to a variable and log the result to the console

variable -= 10;
console.log(variable);

//Activity 3: Comparision Operators

//Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console
console.log(5 > 3);
console.log(5 < 3);

//Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console
console.log(5 >= 3);
console.log(5 <= 5);

//Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console
console.log(5 == 3);
console.log(5 === 3);

//Activity 4: Logical Operators

//Task 11: Write a program that uses && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console
console.log(2 > 3 && 3 < 4);

//Task 12: Write a program that uses || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console
console.log(2 > 3 || 3 < 4);

//Task 13: Write a program that uses ! operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console
console.log(!(2 > 3 && 3 < 4));

//Activity 5: Ternary Operator

//Task 14: Write a program that uses ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console
let result = (10 > 0) ? 'positive' : 'negative';
console.log(result);
